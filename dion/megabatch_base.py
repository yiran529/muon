        tensors, so a captured graph re-reads them on every replay instead of baking them in.

        ``lr`` is always live -- carrying it as a tensor is what lets a ``torch.optim``
        scheduler drive a captured step. ``weight_decay`` is live only when the caller
        supplied a Tensor for it (at construction, ``weight_decay=torch.tensor(0.01)``, or
        by assigning one to the group any time before the graph is captured). That opt-in
        keeps the default float path bit-identical to before: on the AdamW scalar path a
        live weight decay cannot ride ``torch._fused_adamw_``, whose ``weight_decay``
        argument is a float in every overload, so it has to be applied as a separate pass
        and rounds once more.

        The opt-in *latches*: the check re-runs until a Tensor is seen, and never after.
        So an opt-in made after construction still takes effect, while a later
        ``group["weight_decay"] = 0.05`` refills the persistent tensor (as it does for the
        LR) instead of quietly dropping the group back to a value baked in at capture.
        Opting in after a graph exists is too late to be honored -- the graph already baked
        the float -- and ``CudaGraphOptimizer`` raises rather than let that pass silently.

        Every *other* group scalar (``mu``, ``beta1``, ``epsilon``, ...) reaches the kernels
        as a host value and is baked in at capture. Nothing schedules those today; if
        something does, add it here rather than mutating it behind a captured graph.

    Shared megabatch communication + Newton-Schulz orthogonalization.

    This is a generator that yields at async communication points and uses
    ``return value`` to pass the result back to the caller. In Python, ``return``
    inside a generator raises ``StopIteration(value)``, and the caller recovers
    the value via ``result = yield from megabatch_orthogonalize_async(...)``.
    The ``yield from`` transparently forwards intermediate yields to AsyncRuntime.

    Args:
        U: List of tensors to orthogonalize (all same shape).
        comm_dim: Dimension for cat/split in all-to-all (negative index).
            None for non-sharded parameters.
        device_rank: This device's rank.
        world_size: Total number of devices.
        process_group: Distributed process group. None for single-GPU.
        newton_schulz_func: Newton-Schulz orthogonalization function.
        flatten: Whether to flatten 3D+ tensors to 2D.
        epsilon: Small value for numerical stability.
        global_comm_dim_size: Required (non-None) when ``comm_dim is not
            None``; pass ``None`` otherwise. The unsharded (global) size
            along ``comm_dim``, taken from the DTensor's global shape
            (``param.shape[comm_dim]``). Used to compute
            ``padded_local_size = ceil(global / world_size)`` so the
            alltoall sees uniform per-pair sizes across ranks.
        split_sizes: Optional row-block sizes for dim -2. Newton-Schulz runs
            independently per block (on the fully assembled matrices), as if
            each block were a separate parameter.
        split_scales: Optional per-block rescaling applied after Newton-Schulz,
            used to convert the caller's whole-matrix learning-rate adjustment
            into the per-block adjustment.
        return_stacked: If True, return the orthogonalized result as a single
            stacked ``[N, *shape]`` tensor instead of a list of N tensors.
            Callers that immediately re-stack the result (NorMuon, NorDion2 for
            their normalization step) use this to skip an unbind-then-restack
            round-trip. Default False preserves the list contract for callers
            that consume per-parameter tensors directly (Muon, Dion2).
        local_comm_size: Optional explicit per-rank size along ``comm_dim`` to
            pad the local shard to, overriding the ``ceil(global / world_size)``
            derivation. Used by the Dion2/NorDion2 "local" scope, which has
            already selected exactly ``k`` rows per rank before communication:
            passing ``local_comm_size=k`` pads to ``k`` (a no-op when the shard
            is already ``k``, a zero-pad for short shards) so the alltoall stays
            uniform while comm and Newton-Schulz shrink by ``fraction``.
            ``global_comm_dim_size`` still carries the true unsharded size.
